Welcome to the Official Unofficial resource hub for the Center for Comparative Genomics (CCG) at the California Academy of Sciences! 

The CCG is the Academyâ€™s core genomics research center. We employ the latest molecular and computational techniques and utilize natural history specimens to explore biodiversity, conservation, and regeneration.

Here you can find many of our resources such as lab protocols, policies and guidelines.
