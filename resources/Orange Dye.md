# Orange Loading Dye (6X) 

Loading dye is used in gel electrophoresis protocols to accomplish the following:
1. Visualize your sample to more easily load the gel
2. Alter the density of your sample so it sinks properly into the wells of the gel
3. Visualize your sample to track your its migration

To learn more about loading dyes, check out this helpful [resource](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/brands/thermo-scientific/molecular-biology/thermo-scientific-nucleic-acid-electrophoresis-purification/dna-electrophoresis-thermo-scientific/loading-dyes-buffers.html).

### Required Reagents:
- Ficoll
- Orange G (migrates at about 50bp)
- diH20

### Required Materials:
- 50mL falcon tube
- pipette
- weighing boats or paper
- scale with mg capacity
- vortex
- rocker or orbital shaker

## Instructions:
1. In your 50mL falcon tube, add 40 mls of diH20
2. Measure out and add 10 grams of Ficoll
4. Measure out and add 400 mg of Orange G
5. Vortex to mix. Agitate on a rocker or orbital shaker until completely homogenous.
6. Bring the total volume to 50mL with diH20 as needed.
7. Dilute as needed with diH20.
