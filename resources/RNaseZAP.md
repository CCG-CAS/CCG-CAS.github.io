# RNaseZAP Recipe
Full details and original recipe can be found [here.](https://pipettejockey.com/2016/05/06/make-your-own-nucleasenucleic-acid-decontaminating-solution/)

- 10% Store bought bleach (2L per 20L)
- 1% NaOH (200g per 20L)
- 1% Alconox or similar powdered detergent (200g per 20L)

### Instructions for use:
For most applications (Wiping down countertops, equipment, pipettes) the decon solution can be diluted 2-3X, wiped on, allowed to soak for several minutes and then rinsed off with distilled water and towels. More stubborn messes can be hit with undiluted mix.

Glass and parts can be set to soak in straight or diluted (2-3X) decon mix, then washed as normal and rinsed with distilled water.

Donâ€™t let the decon mix come in contact with anodized aluminum, it will take the color right off!
