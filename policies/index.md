# Policies

These are some of the policies covering use of the CCG.

**The CCG is a collaborative lab facility. Our staff maintains equipment, stocks shared consumables, provides orientation to new researchers, and provides advice on project planning. While we can offer a variety of training and guidance, we are not a fee-for-service lab. Instead, our goal is to empower researchers to carry out their own work confidently and effectively.**
