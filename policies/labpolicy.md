# Center for Comparative Genomics Lab Policy

{: .note}
The full CCG Lab Policy can be found [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XwELjrtNjrwxH2nfRIMB51tXVuM1gC7-/view?usp=sharing)

The mission of the Center for Comparative Genomics (CCG) is to support museum and biodiversity genomics research by Academy scientists while training and mentoring the next generation of biodiversity researchers. We strive to be leaders in museum genomics and cutting-edge biodiversity research.

**The CCG is a collaborative lab facility. Our staff maintains equipment, stocks shared consumables, provides orientation to new researchers, and provides advice on project planning. While we can offer a variety of training and guidance, we are not a fee-for-service lab. Instead, our goal is to empower researchers to carry out their own work confidently and effectively.
**

Because the lab is a shared space with many active projects, we’ve created this document to help everyone work together smoothly, equitably, and transparently. Inside, you’ll find:
- CCG Staff Roles and Responsibilities
- One-Month Advanced Notice Guidelines
- Our Core Commitments (how we prioritize work)
- Expectations for Curators or Primary Investigators
- Onboarding Checklist for New Projects
- Departure Checklist for Researchers
