# CCG Freezer Storage Policy

{: .note} 
The complete CCG Freezer Storage Policy can be found [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HGbHiOVYk72Z17v3pOmcVqnXF0o7rze2/view?usp=sharing)

In this document, we outline general freezer storage rules and policies for lab users in the Center for Comparative Genomics. 

**All freezers in CCG Lab Spaces are temporary storage.** This covers items in the fridges and freezers located in CCG Lab Spaces (B2A53, B2A54, B2A55, B2A56). Items associated with active research are welcomed in these spaces, but there is no long-term fridge or freezer storage in the lab work spaces.

**If there is no active lab work for a period of 3 months or more, we ask you please find alternative space to house your items.**

The two -80ºC freezers in the B2 Freezer Room (B2B57), formerly the CCG CryoCollection, are intended for long-term storage of **DNA extracts and molecular products only (no tissues).** Labs and PIs may be assigned a rack for either short-term or long-term use, but all items remain the responsibility of the associated permanent Cal Academy staff member. 

Following proper storage practices ensures space remains safe, organized, and accessible for all users. Inside this document, you’ll find:
