# DNA Extraction from Formalin-Fixed Tissues
As described in Gould et al. 2021; modified from Hykin et al. 2015 and Ruane & Austin, 2017

{: .warning } 
While this protocol does not include any formalin or formaldehyde, seek appropriate training from your department or the CCG Lab Manager before working with or handling formalin-fixed tissues. Formalin/formaldehyde is a carcinogen, mutagen and corrosive chemical that requires extra hazardous materials training per Cal Academy policy.

### Gather the following materials:
- GTE Buffer
- 100% molecular-grade Ethanol
- Nuclease-free water
- Qiagen DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit

### Protocol
1. Aseptically dissect tissue and place into 1 ml of GTE buffer 

2. Soak for 3 hrs at room temperature

3. Place tissue into 1 mL fresh GTE buffer and soak again for 3 hrs. at room temp. 

4. Transfer tissue into 1 mL of fresh GTE buffer and soak overnight (room temp.)

5. The next morning preheat 180 ul aliquots of ATL buffer (QIAGEN) to 98°C

6. Transfer tissue into 1 ml of 100% ethanol for 1 min at room temp.

7. Transfer into 1 ml of 70% ethanol for 5 min at room temp.

8. Transfer into 1 ml of nuclease-free water for 10 min at room temp.

9. Transfer tissue into 180 ul of pre-heated (98°C) ATL buffer (QIAGEN) 

10. Incubate samples at 98°C for 15 min

11. Immediately place samples on ice for at least 2 min. 

12. Once cooled, add 40 ul of proteinase K to each sample

13. Vortex and incubate samples at 60°C for 48 hrs on a shaking heat block 

14. Vortex samples periodically and add additional 20 ul aliquots of proteinase K as needed to digest tissue (up to 100 ul total) 

15. Following this incubation period, extract DNA using the QIAGEN DNEasy Blood and Tissue Kit as described 

16. Elute DNA into 50 ul of nuclease-free water after a 3-min incubation at 55°C
