# QIAGEN QIAamp Micro Kit Protocol: Tissue
Adapted from QIAGEN [manufacturer protocol](https://www.qiagen.com/ch/~/media/4D8DF38311F64606847546D1A40F0985.ashx).

{: .note }
If you are extracting DNA from small samples that are stored in EtOH, it is best to dry your sample of any EtOH before carrying out the extraction. You can do this by placing open tubes in the incubator; check on them every (approximately) 5 minutes.

### Gather the following materials _(per sample):_

#### Consumables
- (1) Eppendorf tube, locking, 1.5 mL, labeled
- (1) QIAGEN spin filter column, labeled
- (3) QIAGEN collection tubes
- (1) Sample storage tube (Eppendorf or screw-cap, 1.5–2 mL), labeled

#### Reagent aliquots, labeled (including your initials):
- Proteinase K
- ATL buffer
- AL buffer
- 100% ethanol, molecular-grade
- AW1 wash
- AW2 wash
- AE buffer (or molecular-grade water)
- Carrier RNA (dissolved, in aliquot)

### Preparation
- Bring elution buffer (Buffer AE or molecular-grade water) to room temperature.
- ATL and AL buffers may precipitate at room temperature. If precipitate is present, incubate at 55–70°C for a few minutes to re-dissolve.
- Pre-heat incubator to 56 °C.
- Thaw an aliquot of carrier RNA on ice.

### Protocol
1. Transfer a single very small (<10 mg) tissue sample to a 1.5 mL  tube.

    {: .note }
    Cut tissue on either a glass petri dish or a piece of parafilm. Be sure to use clean forceps and a clean scalpel/razor blade for each sample. You may reuse your forceps if utilizing the _Germinator_, but please return forceps to the dirty container when finished. QIAGEN recommends preparing tissues on a cold surface, such as a metal plate placed on dry ice.

2. Add 180 µL ATL Buffer (large blue tube) to sample tube. Allow to equilibrate to room temperature.
3. Add 20 µL Proteinase K to sample tube. Vortex and spin down.
4. Incubate at 56°C 4–6 hours, overnight, or until the sample is completely lysed. 
5. Remove samples from incubator and spin down to remove condensation from tube caps.
    
    Be mindful when opening your tubes as the lids can be dirty with solution after being inverted during incubation. If at any point your gloves become dirty, change them.  Be very careful not to allow any cross-contamination of the samples.

6. Add 200 µL AL Buffer (green tube) to each tube.

    {: .note }
    Use filtered tips here as the soapy consistency of this buffer can otherwise cause the liquid to travel up the pipette shaft and into the pipette.
    
7. Add 1 µg dissolved carrier RNA to each sample. Vortex thoroughly and spin down.
8. Add 200 µL 100% EtOH to each tube. Use the same precautions as in step 7, including the use of filtered tips.
9. Ensure your tubes are locked closed. Vortex thoroughly and spin down.
10. Incubate for 5 min at room temperature. 
11. Carefully transfer the entire lysate (≈600 µL) from step to the QIAamp MinElute column (in a 2 mL collection tube) without wetting the rim.

    {: .note }
    Use a P1000 with a filtered tip. When taking up the solution, avoid clumps of undigested tissue to prevent clogging the filter. Be sure not to touch or puncture the spin column filter with your pipette tip.
    
12. Centrifuge 1 min at 6000 g (8000 rpm).  When you remove the tubes from the centrifuge, verify that all liquid transferred from the spin column to the collection tube. Discard flowthrough into the Hazardous Waste container. 
    
    {: .note }
    If you see liquid still in the spin column, this means the filter in the column is clogged. Before proceeding, spin those clogged tubes again for 15 seconds at 13,000 x g (12,700 rpm). If the filter remains clogged, use a pipette to aspirate off and discard the supernatant that is in the spin column before proceeding.

13. Transfer spin columns to new 2 mL collection tubes.
14. Add 500 µL AW1 Buffer (white cap) to spin columns without wetting the rim.
15. Centrifuge spin columns 1 min at 6,000 g (8,000 rpm). Discard flowthrough.
16. Transfer the spin columns to new 2 mL collection tubes.
17. Add 500 µL of AW2 Buffer (blue cap) to each of the spin columns without wetting the rim.
18. Centrifuge 3 min at 20,000 g (14,000 rpm). Discard flowthrough.
    
    {: .note }
    When removing the spin columns from the centrifuge, be careful not to let the flowthrough come into contact with the spin column. If this happens, spin for 15 sec at the same speed to dry the column again. 
    
19. Transfer the spin columns to labeled, 2.0 mL screw-cap tubes. 

    {: .caution }
    It is very important at this step that you transfer the correct spin column to the correct labeled 2.0 mL storage tube! Be sure tubes are labeled with your extraction ID and extraction date.
    
20. Add 20–100 µL of AE Buffer (yellow tube) or molecular-grade water to the spin column membrane, being careful not to touch or puncture the membrane with the pipette tip.
    
    {: .note }
    The volume of eluate may be up to 5 µL less than the volume of the solution applied to the column.
    
21. Incubate 3 minutes at room temperature to increase DNA yield.
22. Centrifuge 1 min at 20,000 g (14,000 rpm).
23. Discard your spin columns. Cap your tubes (with labels) and proceed to quantification.
